- A high-level view of the various system components must be provided, for example by using components diagram
- The chosen architecture must be described (for example, layered architecture)

## Modelling

- This section explains how the domain has been modelled
- This section should contains some class diagrams
    - The application's most relevant design aspects are highlighted, showcasing how they solve the problems described in the analysis
    - Diagrams do not show implementation aspects that are not relevant, such as private fields
- This section describe how the tactical patterns and other aspects of DDD seen in class were applied


## Interaction
- This section explains the behavior of the system, for instance using sequence or activity diagrams
