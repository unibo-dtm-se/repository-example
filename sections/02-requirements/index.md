# Requirements

- The requirements must explain what the application will have to do. You should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on what you want the application to do

- HAHAH this has been hacked by me

- Requirements are divided into:

- If there are unclear terms (ambiguous, very complex, etc.) these should be explained
- Each requirement must have its own acceptance criteria
